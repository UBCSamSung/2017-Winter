## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goal is to help students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC develop software skills for science.

### Winter 2017: Neural Networks and Deep Learning in Python

#### OUTLINE

* What are the **learning goals**?
  * To learn the basics of neural networks and deep learning
  * To master [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) for solving machine learning problems
  * To master [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming for scientific computing
  * To meet and collaborate with other students and faculty interested in scientific computing
* What **software tools** are we going to use?
  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): machine learning in Python
  * [SciPy Stack](http://scipy.org/): scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
* What **scientific topics** will we study?
  * Neural networks and deep learning:
    * [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen
    * [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
    * [deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/)
  * Advanced machine learning topics following [scikit-learn tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)
* Where do we start? What are the **prerequisites**?
  * UBCS3 Winter 2017 is a continuation of [UBCS3 Fall 2016](https://github.com/ubcs3/2016-Fall):
    * Machine learning fundamentals: regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction
    * Natural language processing
  * Calculus, linear algebra, and probability
* Who is the target **audience**?
  * Everyone is invited!
  * If the outline above is at your level, perfect! Get ready to write a lot of code!
  * If the outline above seems too intimidating, come anyway! You'll learn things just by being exposed to new tools and ideas, and meeting new people!
  * If you have experience with all the topics outlined above, come anyway! You'll become more of an expert by participating as a helper/instructor!
